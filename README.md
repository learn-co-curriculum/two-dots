# Donut App
Here's the situation.  You're throwing an elegant Donut Party for you and some friends.  It's going to be super classy.  There'll be dancing, dunking, and fingers covered is glazed frosting.

But here are the problems... It's stressful being the host of a swanky swarray.  You're worried you guests will be upset if there aren't enough donuts, and you're terrified that if you have to many Donuts per guest you'll turn your guests into murderous donut craving zombies.  

Donutitis is a real threat these days. Symptoms include, but are not limited to, homocidal rages, inabitility to communicate beyond screaming "DONUTS!1!!" or "SSADF?ADSF!??", paralysis, the hallucinations of a world inhabited solely by donuts for the eating, and - of course - death.

So like I said, it can be stressfull being a host to a donut party.  You need to create a machine that calculates if there are fewer donuts than guests, which will make them sad.  You must also check that there's no more than four donuts per guest, lest you want a slaughter on your hands.  With this app never again will you endure sleepless nights worrying if you have enough donuts on hand for your hungry friends.
